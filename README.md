React Card UI Project

A simple and reusable Card UI component built using React.
This project focuses on understanding and practicing React components, props, and clean component structure.
It serves as a beginner-friendly UI module that can be reused across multiple React applications.

🚀 About the Project

This project showcases a set of elegant card components built in React.
During development, the main learning goals were:

Understanding React functional components

Passing and handling props to make components dynamic

Structuring components for reusability

Styling UI elements cleanly

Rendering lists of cards using arrays of objects

Practicing modular code organization in a real-world UI scenario

The final outcome is a customizable Card UI that displays job openings (or any other structured data) using props.
